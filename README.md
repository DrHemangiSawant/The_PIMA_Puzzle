# Analysis of Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

About Dataset:

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.


Content of Dataset:

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

About Analysis:

1. Diabetic vs Non-Diabetic Population - 
We identified how many people in the dataset are diabetic vs non-diabetic.
Visualized the distribution using a bar graph.

3. Pregnancies & Diabetic Analysis - 
Analyzed the number of people according to the number of pregnancies.
Visualized the number of pregnancies using a histogram.
Analyzed the number of pregnant women who were diabetic, including those under 30 years of age.

5. Glucose Level Analysis - 
Explored glucose levels of diabetic and non-diabetic people.
Analyzed how many individuals had glucose levels over 100 but were not diagnosed as diabetic.

7. Age-Based Analysis - 
Focused on people under 30 years old, identifying those with glucose levels over 100 and diabetic status.
Explored pregnancies in diabetic women under 30.
Created stacked bar graphs to visualize the number of pregnant women with high glucose levels according to age.

Visualizations
Several plots and charts were generated during the analysis, including:

Bar graphs for diabetic vs non-diabetic population.
Histograms for pregnancies and glucose levels.
Stacked bar graphs representing glucose levels and pregnancies by age.
